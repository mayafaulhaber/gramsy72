        <p>Did you already go out on all those dinners you were talking about?<br>
           If so, then I hope you had a lot of fun; If not, then there will be fun to come!<br>
           Well, I hope you had/have a great birthday, and i'm wishing I was there with you right now.<br>
           About when I got the mixer, I started a dance music project called TacoCat. I will be in direct recording soon with that splitter thing,<Br>
           but right now this song is just me and the keyboards on a room recording with no MIDI sync, (yeah, I can't quite understand it either), but this
         <br>is my first song recorded "Strike One", an preview release to the album "Powered" </p>
